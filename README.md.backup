# UbiCoach Logo Pack

This repository includes the logos for UbiCoach® brand websites, documents and other branded materials. The details, definitions and descriptions are not intended to be adaptable to anything other then the application to UbiCoach®.

## Image File Formats

The UbiCoach® logos are all vector in format, so all original files will be stored as such. For our purposes, this will be the SVG format.

> **SVG vs EPS**:
> The SVG format is newer and best suited for the web. the EPS format is older (and no longer in development), but is best suited for printing. SVG is XML while EPS is Postscript based.

Exports for raster format needs will be provided in the PNG format, with transparency.

>**PNG**: This is a common and modern good quality raster image format. This format offers transparency.
>
>**WebP** [By Request Only]: This is a newer and less common raster format developed by Google that offers numerous advantages, but is still lacking universal support as exists with other formats. This format offers transparency.
>
>**JPG/JPEG** [By Request Only]: This is a legacy raster image format that is essentially obsolete, but is not going anywhere anytime soon. This format does not offer transparency. Unless it is required for a certain application, there is **no reason** to use this format. Exporting a vector image to JPG often leads to artifacts that are not desirable. It will be provided with a white background only. This is primarily used for printing on white paper.

## Logo Types

There are three different styles of the UbiCoach® logo.

1. The full rectangular logo, with a size of **960x372**. This is the standard and normal UbiCoach logo and should be used whenever possible.
2. The full square logo, with a size of **900x900**. This is an alternative logo that should be used when a square size is required.
3. The small square logo containing only the graphic, with a size of **500x500**. This is a logo that should only be used when a small size is needed. Examples are icons, favicons, profile image, etc.

## Logo Variants

The logos will be available in full color and white, both with transparent backgrounds. With vector images, a background color really serves no purpose and does nothing but cause problems.

## Specific Needs

Should a logo of any variation or variety be needed, a request must be submitted. It will be reviewed and if approved, a proper file will be provided and added to the logo pack for current and future use.

There are numerous considerations for approving a logo request. While a need is never dismissed, there is also an ongoing development issue with each additional type, and variation, added.

## Maintenance

The UbiCoach® logo is a vector image, for all variations. Due to this, raster image softwares should never be used for making new versions or variations.

To maintain compatibility and quality standards, softwares used should comply with the W3C specifications for SVG files. These softwares include:

1. Inkscape
2. Adobe Illustrator
3. Corel Draw
4. Freehand
5. Xara X

Software that is Raster based, even if it can open Vector formats, should not be used. These softwares include:

1. GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
2. Adobe Photoshop
3. Corel Painter
4. Krita
5. Sketchbook Pro

While open source is always preferred due to compatibility reasons, any software that saves in the true open standard SVG format should work just fine.

There are also, for more experienced users, some command line (CLI) tools to manipulate and convert images, including:

1. ImageMagick
2. Inkscape
3. GraphicsMagick
